### **Project Overview**

### **Smart Recipe Generator**
A Streamlit web app that helps you create a personalized weekly meal plan based on your dietary preferences and available ingredients, with AI-powered nutrition tips.

## How It Works
1. **User Input:**
   Fill out the form to specify dietary preferences and ingredients.
2. **Nutrition Tip:**
   The app displays a nutrition tip generated by Gemini AI.
3. **Recipe Generation:**
   On form submission, the app fetches 7 recipes matching the criteria using the [`get_recipes`](../services/api_utils.py) function.
4. **Weekly Plan:**
   Recipes are assigned to days of the week and displayed. The plan can be downloaded.
## Key Dependencies
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [google-generativeai](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)

## How the Application Works for the User

### 2. Customize Your Recipe Search

- **Diet Selection:**
  Choose your preferred diet from a dropdown:
  - `none` (no restriction)
  - `vegan`
  - `vegetarian`
  - `gluten free`
    
- **Ingredients You Have:**
  
  Enter a comma-separated list of ingredients you want to use (e.g., `rice, tomatoes`).
  This helps the app suggest recipes that match what you already have at home.
  
- **Ingredients to Exclude:**
  Enter ingredients you want to avoid (e.g., due to allergies or dislikes, like `peanut, dairy`).
  
- **Max Cooking Time:**
  Use the slider to set the maximum time (in minutes) you want to spend cooking each meal.
  
- **Number of People to Serve:**
-   Use the slider to set how many servings you need for each recipe.
- **Generate Recipes:**- 
-   Click the "Generate Recipes" button to start the search.

### 3. Get a Gemini Nutrition Tip
- As soon as you enter ingredients, the app uses Google Gemini AI to generate a helpful nutrition or healthy cooking tip tailored to your chosen ingredients.
- The tip appears in an info box for easy reading.
- If there’s an issue with the AI service, you’ll see a warning message.
---
### 4. View Your Weekly Meal Plan
- After submitting the form, the app:
  - Searches for 7 recipes that match your criteria.
  - Shows a spinner while searching.
  - If recipes are found:
    - Displays a success message with the number of recipes.
    - For each recipe:
      - Shows the recipe title in an expandable section.
      - Displays a recipe image.
      - Lists the cooking time and serving size.
      - Provides a link to the full recipe instructions.
  - If no recipes are found, you’ll see a warning.
---
### 5. Review and Download Your Plan
- The app assigns each recipe to a day of the week (Monday to Sunday).
- Your weekly plan is displayed in a simple list (e.g., `Monday: Veggie Stir Fry`).
- Click the ":inbox_tray: Download Weekly Plan (.txt)" button to save your plan as a text file for easy reference.
